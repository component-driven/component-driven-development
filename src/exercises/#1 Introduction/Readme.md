[React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) is a tool we are using as a workbench to develop components, and to generate a style guide.

## The task

1. Explore React Styleguidist UI, try to switch to isolated mode (a button in the top right corner), try to edit the example code.
1. Edit examples in `Button.md`, add a new example.
1. Edit a component source in `Button.js`. See how all examples update every time you save a file.
1. Edit component’s `PropTypes` definition. See how “Props & methods” section reacts to the updates.
1. Add a new component and an example file and see how it's automatically added to the style guide.
