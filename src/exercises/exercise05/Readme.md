## Creating a generic link component

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 5`.

### Task

Create a components that renders a link. Link should have a hover state with a different color.

**Hint:** [Use `&`](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#supported-css) to refer to a component class name.

#### Bonus

Add a variation that renders text using the base color (hover should be the same as in the default variation). [Prop is used](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props) to change a variation.

### Solution

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/core/Link/Link.js).
