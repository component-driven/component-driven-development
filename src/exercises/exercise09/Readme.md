# Creating a photo grid

## Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 9`.

## Task

Create a photo grid: render an array of photos (`DogPhoto` component) with gaps between each photo but not around the container.

**Hint:** use negative margins on the container to remove extra gaps.

## If youâ€™re stuck

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/app/Dogs.js).
