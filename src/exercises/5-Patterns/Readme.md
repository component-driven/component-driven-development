## 5.1 Rewrite the Button

To make our Button more usable, we need to accommodate for different use cases. In our design system we're going to have 2 different _variants_ of the Button: `primary` and `secondary`. We also don't want users of our Button to screw it up by specifying the `padding` or other styles of it.

### The task

1. Rewrite the Button we created before. Tip: use `css` function from `@styled-system/css` to get access to design tokens.
1. Make it less flexible: we don't want `padding` and `border` be customizable via props
1. Add `secondary` and `primary` variants to the button and allow choosing them via props

### The result

```jsx padded
<Button>Push me</Button>
<Button variant="primary">Push me</Button>
```

## 5.2 Creating simple UI Patterns

Let's create a simple `Label` UI pattern.

### The task

1. When `required=true` display a red `*` next to the label
1. Use `label` HTML element and appropriate aria attributes

### The result

```jsx
<Label required>I'm a label</Label>
```

## 5.3 Using primitives to compose UI patterns

In the previous exercise we learned how to manage whitespace around our primitives. Now it's time to use what we learned and create an application specific component.

Using `Box`, `Flex`, and `Grid` components we can create really complex layouts without writing custom CSS. And, since the values for the spacing are coming from our [spacing scale](https://cdds.netlify.com/styleguide/#/Foundation?id=spacing) we can be sure our layouts are consistent across the whole application.

Let's create a LoginForm with the primitives we created today.

### The result

```jsx
<LoginForm />
```

### The task

1. Create a `LoginForm` component.
1. Use only primitives for layout, whitespace (`Box`, `Flex`, `Grid`, and `Stack`) and text (`Text`, `Heading` and `Link`).
1. Bonus points: make the form responsive. On small screens, labels should be displayed over the input fields.
