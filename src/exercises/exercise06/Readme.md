## Creating a generic button component

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 6`.

### Task

Create a components that renders a button. Button should have hover/active, focus and disabled states.

**Hint:** You may want to disable hover on disabled button: you can do it using pseude selectors — `&:hover:enabled {}`.

#### Mega bonus

If that’s too easy for you, try to use the Box component from Styled Grid to define paddings inside a button.

**Hint:** Have a look at an example in [Foundation](https://sapegin.github.io/component-driven-development/styleguide/#foundation) of a style guide (`npm run styleguide`).

### Solution

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/core/Button/Button.js).
