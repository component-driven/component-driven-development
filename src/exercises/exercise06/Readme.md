## Creating a generic link component

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 6`.

### Task

Create a components that renders a button. Button should have hover/active, focus and disabled states.

**Hint:** You may want to disable hover on disabled button: you can do it using this selector — `&:hover:not(:disabled) {}`.

#### Mega bonus

If that’s too easy for you, try to use the Box component from Styled Grid to define paddings inside a button.

**Hint:** Have a look at an example in Foundation of a style guide.

### If you’re stuck

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/core/Button.js).
