## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are the single source of truth for projectâ€™s colors, whitespace, font sizes and other design decisions.

We're prepared the basic structure for the design tokens definition. Open `theme.js` in the exercise directory

### The task

1. Add a few colors to the `theme.js` and see how the styleguide going to render them
1. Define appropriate names for colors (group exrecise)
1. Check out [design tokens](http://localhost:6060/#/Foundation?id=colors) from the final styleguide

## Colors

```jsx noeditor
import Colors from '../../styleguide/Colors';
import theme from './theme';

<Colors theme={theme} />;
```
