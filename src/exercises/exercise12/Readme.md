## Final exercise: create an app layout

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 12`. Use files in the `src/exercises/exercise12` folder.

### Task

Now combine all components to create an app layout:

* heading with the app name;
* dog finder UI (`DogFinder` component);
* subscription form heading
* subscription form UI (`SubscriptionForm` component);
* sticky footer with the copyright (`Footer`Â component).

**Hint:** Most of the layout can be implemented using the Box component from Styled Grid.

### Solution

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/app/Layout.js).
