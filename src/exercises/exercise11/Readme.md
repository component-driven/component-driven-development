## Creating a sticky footer component

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 11`.

### Task

Create two components that will encapsulate styles required for a sticky footer:

* A container (wrapper) component (`Container`), that
* A footer component (`Footer`), that shifts its content to the bottom of the page.

**Hint:** use `vh` (viewport height) units to make a wrapper at least 100% of the page height.

**Hint:** use flexbox and `margin-top: auto`Â to move a block to the end of the container.

### Solution

See the completed [code of this example](../../components/app/Dogs.js).
