## React Styleguidist introduction

### Getting started

Run Styleguidist: `npm run exercise 1`.

[React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) is a tool that we use as a workbench to develop component, and to generate a style guide.

### The task

1.  Explore React Styleguidist UI, try to switch to isolated mode, try to edit example code.

2.  Edit a examples in `Button.md`, add a new example.

3.  Edit a component in `Button.js`. See how all examples update every time you save a file.

4.  Edit component’s `PropTypes` definition. Open “Props & methods” to see that the documentation updates.

5.  Add a new component and an example file and see how it's added to the style guide.
