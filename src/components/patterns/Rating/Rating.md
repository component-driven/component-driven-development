Rating should be used when we want to promote a specific piece of content in order to democratically help decide what content is of higher quality.

```js
<Rating value={1} />
<Rating value={3} />
<Rating value={5} />
<Rating value={3.4} />
<Rating value={3.5} />
<Rating value={3.9} />
```

Values are rounded down to the nearest half to simplify code usage.
