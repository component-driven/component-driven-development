## Why building your own component library?

### How are we have been building UIs

1. Get a static mockup from a designer
1. Write HTML markup that represents the mockup
1. Write CSS and connect with HTML using classes
1. "Sprinkle" JavaScript using classes to add interactivity
1. Hand off to a backend developer
1. Replace HTML with PHP, Ruby, Java, ...
1. ...
1. Profit

# What's the problem with static mockups?

## Static mockups...

- not covering all possible states
- not covering all possible resolutions
- losing lots of design knowledge during ~~translation~~ hand-off

---

<Boom>

## Mockups are _static_

## Applications are _dynamic_

<Stack gridGap={4} gridTemplateColumns="auto 1fr auto" alignItems="center">

	<Code language="html">{`<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>Text</p>`}</Code>

## CSS is too expressive üë©‚Äçüé®

<Notes>
	Rudimentary abilities of HTML coupled with an incredibly powerful declarative
	nature of CSS gives developers a false sense of simplicity when building
	things for the Web.

## Sources of inconsistencies

- Color
- Typography
- Spacing

---

# Primitives

---

> Primitives are the building blocks of your user interface.

---

---

## `<button> != <Button>`

<Appear>

## `<p> != <Text>`

## `<h1> != <Heading>`

</Appear>

---

## HTML vs Primitives

<Stack gridGap={4} gridTemplateColumns="1fr 1fr">

<Code language="html">{dropdown.html}</Code>

<Code language="javascript">{dropdown.jsx}</Code>

</Stack>

### How are we building UIs with primitives and patterns

1. Get a static mockup from a designer
1. Get data from API endpoint
1. Assembly UI using primitives or re-use a pattern.
1. ...
